# Introduction

Cherry is a live inventory of definitions for the UI components, design patterns, naming conventions, brand assets and code guidelines which the whole design team at Deep Impact works from, keeping all of our products cohesive.

Cherry is one kind of a process that unifies design and implementation ✌

🍒 **Cherry** can be used as:
- ⚖ - A design philosophy
- 💎 - Sketch library
- 🎨 - PostCSS variables and mixins
- ✍ - Single purpose CSS classes
- ⚛ - React components

---

We are just getting started, the evolution of Cherry will depend on the team. Any new rule or convention applied will have to be consensual.
