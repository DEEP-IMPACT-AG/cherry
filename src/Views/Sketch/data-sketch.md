# Sketch

Cherry provides a [Sketch Library](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/) to be used as a template for every new project you start designing.
The template contains the typography styles with the corresponding naming conventions, buttons and form elements.

This template will help with implementation and planning from design to code.
